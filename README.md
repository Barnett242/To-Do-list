# To-Do-list
In this Mini project I created a to do list that allows me to add and remove elements using HTML, CSS and Javascript
This small project also allows me to keep tract of my task and manage workloads to keep me on track with my busy schedule, I also use it as a remindeer
to keep me organize and focused so it makes it very convenient and helpful
